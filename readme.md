# Github apps

## This is a python script that creates github app token in runtime and expires it in one hour

Initially, came up a github plugin that is able to do the work: <https://github.com/navikt/github-app-token-generator>

But, we had github cloud(github.com) and github enterprise(customer.github.com), then was necessary to change the script to accept both domains and github apps.

The script was done using this github documentation  <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps>
